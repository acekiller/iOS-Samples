 Abstract: A table view controller to manage and display a list of recent search strings.
 The search strings are stored in NSUserDefaults to maintain the list between launches of the application.
 The view controller manages two arrays:
 * recentSearches is the array that corresponds to the full set of recent search strings stored in user defaults.
 * displayedRecentSearches is an array derived from recent searches, filtered by the current search string (if any).
 
 The recentSearches array is kept synchronized with user defaults, and avoids the need to query user defaults every time the search string is updated.
 
 The table view displays the contents of the displayedRecentSearches array.
 
 The view controller has a delegate that it notifies if row in the table view is selected.
 
  Version: 1.2
